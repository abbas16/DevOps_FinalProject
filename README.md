Launching AWS EC2 via Bash, Dockerized CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Grafana Monitoring.

This project automates the process of launching an EC2 instance on AWS using GitHub Actions. Whenever you push code to the main branch, a fresh server is created â€” complete with Docker, Nginx, Grafana, Prometheus, and Node Exporter. You can monitor with Grafana.



âœ… What This Project Does

âœ” Automatically launches an EC2 instance when code is pushed to GitHub

âœ” Installs Docker and deploys:

Nginx (on port 80)

Grafana (on port 3000)

Prometheus (on port 9090)

Node Exporter (on port 9100 for system metrics)

âœ” Sets up monitoring using Grafana dashboards



How the Workflow Works

ðŸ”¹ 1. You push code to GitHub (main branch)

âž¡ GitHub Actions starts automatically

âž¡ AWS credentials from GitHub Secrets are used

âž¡ Launch_Instance.sh runs and:

Creates an EC2 instance

Installs Docker

Deploys Nginx, Grafana, Prometheus, Node Exporter


ðŸ”¹ 2. Access the tools in your browser

Service	URL Example

Nginx	http://<EC2-Public-IP>

Grafana	http://<EC2-Public-IP>:3000

Prometheus	http://<EC2-Public-IP>:9090

Node Exporter	http://<EC2-Public-IP>:9100/metrics



ðŸ“Š Grafana Monitoring Flow

Node Exporter collects CPU, RAM, Disk, Network data

Prometheus stores these metrics

Grafana reads data from Prometheus and displays dashboards
